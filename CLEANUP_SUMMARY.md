# UI Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Successfully Cleaned Up

  - Removed category filters and complex UI
  - **Added** simple stats cards (Agents, Integrations, Organizations)

### 📁 **Kept for Development**
- ✅ **Preserved** `/app/widget/demo/[agentId]/page.tsx` - Widget demo with ID parameter (as requested)

## 🏗️ **Current Clean Structure**

### **Working Pages:**
- `/` - Simple redirect to dashboard
- `/dashboard` - Clean overview with stats and quick actions
- `/dashboard/agents` - Agent management (needs V2 API connection)
- `/dashboard/agents/new` - Agent creation (needs V2 API connection) 
- `/dashboard/agents/[id]` - Agent details (needs V2 API connection)
- `/dashboard/agents/[id]/edit` - Agent editing (needs V2 API connection)
- `/chat/[id]` - Chat interface
- `/widget/demo/[agentId]` - Widget demo

### **Working Navigation:**
- Overview (Dashboard)
- Agents (Full agent management)

### **APIs Available:**
- V1 APIs (legacy)
- V2 APIs (new normalized schema) - ready for UI integration

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

The UI is now clean and ready for V2 API integration. The main tasks ahead:

1. **Connect agent pages to V2 API** - Update all agent management to use new endpoints
2. **Add real data to dashboard stats** - Connect stats cards to V2 API counts
3. **Add integrations UI** - Create pages for managing organization-level integrations
4. **Add organizations UI** - Create pages for organization management

The cleanup is complete and the foundation is solid for connecting to the V2 API! 🚀
